# Getting Started with Waypoint and Flask

This is a slightly-modified version of the docker/python example, with changes
to publish to AWS ECR and deploy to AWS ECS, instead of a local Docker setup.

1. Run `waypoint init` in this example directory with `waypoint.hcl`.
1. Run `waypoint up` to build and deploy the application.

For more information on Flask, see [https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).
